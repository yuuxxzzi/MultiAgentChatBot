Product Requirements Document - Multi-Agent Counseling LLM System

Overview:
Multi-agent based counseling LLM system for MZ generation
5 specialized agents: Emotion Analysis, Counseling, Role-playing, Mindfulness, Report Generation
Target: Non-face-to-face text-based emotional counseling

Core Problems to Solve:
- Single-agent limitations in emotion tracking and immediate intervention
- Lack of real-time emotional response and personalized feedback
- Insufficient emotional immersion

Core Features:

1. Emotion Analysis Agent
- Real-time emotion tagging and intensity tracking
- KcELECTRA or BERT-based classification models
- Crisis detection capabilities

2. Counseling Agent  
- CBT-based empathy responses and Socratic questioning
- 4-stage CBT flow structure using GPT-4o
- Cognitive reconstruction guidance

3. Role-playing Agent
- Psychodrama conversations based on past events
- GPT-based role-playing prompt generation
- Emotion threshold-based triggers

4. Mindfulness Agent
- Meditation and breathing guidance during crisis states
- Emotional stabilization techniques
- Conditional branching based on emotional intensity

5. Report Generation Agent
- Conversation logs and emotion visualization
- Python-based visualization and summarization
- User reflection insights

Technical Architecture:

System Components:
- Multi-agent orchestration system
- Frontend: Streamlit or Gradio
- Backend: REST API or WebSocket integration
- LangGraph-based state transition model

Data Models:
- Emotion data with labels and scores
- Conversation logs and session records
- Anonymous ID-based counseling history

APIs and Integrations:
- GPT-4o API
- HuggingFace Transformers
- Python Matplotlib for visualization
- RESTful API design

Infrastructure:
- GPU computing environment
- HTTPS secure connections
- Anonymized database storage
- Session management system

Development Roadmap:

Phase 2 - Interactive Features:
- Role-playing agent integration
- Mindfulness intervention system
- Enhanced emotion analysis
- Improved report visualization

Phase 3 - Refinement:
- Top-k example integration
- Personalization system
- User satisfaction evaluation
- Multi-session storage

Logical Dependencies:
