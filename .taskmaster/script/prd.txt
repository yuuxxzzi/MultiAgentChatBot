Multi-Agent Counseling LLM System PRD

## Overview
Build a multi-agent based counseling LLM system for MZ generation.
Agents handle emotion analysis, CBT therapy, psychodrama role-playing, mindfulness interventions, and counseling reports.
Target users are MZ generation who prefer non-face-to-face text communication.

This system solves:
- Limitations of single-agent structures
- Absence of real-time emotional response
- Failure to induce emotional immersion

## Core Features

### 1. Emotion Analysis Agent
- Real-time text emotion tagging and intensity tracking
- Crisis detection capabilities
- KcELECTRA or BERT-based classification models

### 2. Counseling Agent
- Empathy-based responses and CBT question generation
- Socratic questioning methods
- GPT-4o utilization with 4-stage CBT flow

### 3. Role-playing Agent
- Psychodrama conversations based on past events
- Emotional immersion and self-insight
- GPT-based role-playing prompt generation

### 4. Mindfulness Agent
- Meditation and breathing guidance during crisis
- Emotional stabilization techniques
- Conditional branching based on emotional intensity

### 5. Report Generation Agent
- Conversation logs and emotion visualization reports
- User insights and counseling reflection
- Python-based visualization and summarization

## Technical Architecture

### System Components
- Multi-agent system (Counseling, Emotion Analysis, Roleplay, Mindfulness, Report)
- Frontend: Streamlit or Gradio
- Backend: REST API or WebSocket integration
- Data flow: LangGraph-based state transition model

### Data Models
- Emotion data (labels and scores)
- Conversation logs and session records
- Anonymous ID-based counseling history

### APIs and Integrations
- GPT-4o API
- HuggingFace Transformers
- Python Matplotlib
- RESTful API

### Infrastructure Requirements
- GPU computing environment
- HTTPS secure connection
- Anonymized DB storage and session management

## Development Roadmap

### MVP Requirements
- Real-time emotion analysis
- CBT conversation flow construction
- Basic report generation
- Web interface provision

### Phase 2: Interactive Features
- Role-playing agent addition
- Mindfulness intervention addition
- Enhanced emotion analysis
- Improved report visualization

### Phase 3: Refinement and Scale
- Top-k examples insertion
- Personalization system
- User satisfaction evaluation
- Multi-session storage functionality

## Logical Dependencies
1. Emotion analysis agent
2. Counseling agent
3. Frontend UI and report generation
4. Role-playing and mindfulness
5. LangGraph integration

## Risks and Mitigations
- Low emotion analysis accuracy - Fine-tune Korean sentiment models
- Inconsistent GPT responses - Example-based prompt design
- Unbalanced role distribution - Clear functional division
- Personal information exposure - UUID and masking processing
- Excessive MVP scope - Prioritize core functionality development
